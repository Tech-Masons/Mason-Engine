# Coding Conventions
## Naming
- Variable names should be in camel case:
    `int newVariable = 23`
- Pointer variable names should start with a p and be in pascal case:
    `int* pTestPointer`
- Function names should be in pascal case:
    `int getVariable()`
- Global variables follow the normal variable naming convention.
## Seperators
- Curly braces should be on a new line.
- Brackets shouldn't have any extra spaces:
    `int* array = new int[23]`
## Operators
- Put spaces around operators:
  `int x = 2 + 3`
## Files/Folders
- Files should be in camel case:
    `TestClass.cpp`
- Folders should be in no case:
    `folder`
## Macros
- Macros should be in snake case or screaming snake case:
  `TEST_MACRO or test_macro`
