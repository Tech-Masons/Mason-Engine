    - this will cause the solution to be created and copy asset files to their respective paths inside the editor. (debugging)
2. open solution. select which startup project you will be working with, for example `editor` 
3. Build Project. `Crtl + Shift + B`
    - this will cause the files copied to be copied the release config folder so that it may be used outside of visual studio (ie release, renderDoc)
